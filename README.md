# Find Your Hat
_______________________________________________________

## About

- Codecademy project with very little guidence.
- Practice with node.js and classes
- There are two versions of the game:
    - Normal version based on codecademy instructions.
    - Programming version where you don't see your moves
      until after you finish programming them.

## Basics

1. Give directions to move the * toward the ^.
2. Don't move off the edge or in a hole 'O'.
3. If you achieve step 1 without step 2, you win.

## More Details

In the game you give instructions by typing 
"u","d","l","r" for up, down, left, or right
followed by the return/enter key. 

In the normal version you will see your moves printed
immediatly after a move command. In the programming version
you will make all your movement commands first, then type
"done" when you think you are finished. You will then see your
moves printed one at a time to see if you reached the hat.

#### Note

To start the program you need to have node.js installed. 
To run the program in the terminal, go to the folder where it
is downloaded and type "node main.js".
